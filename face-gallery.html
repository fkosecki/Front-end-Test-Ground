            <img src="icons/heart.png">
            <p>We're still young enough to learn new things. We quickly adapt to new technologies and put them in use
                whenever there is profit for our projects.</p>

            <img src="icons/briefcase.png">

            <p>We don't have direct experience in commercial software development... yet. We have worked on some college
                projects - both solo and in teams. Different coding languages, with projects mostly focused on
                functionality (unfortunately). Nevertheless in our current project - ERP Consultant - we've gained
                insight in buisness side of
                applications. Multiple solutions have been designed by our CEO - FK. </p>

            <p>In all of our up to date projects, we've thrived for perfection. We understand the responsibility that
                comes with the trust given to us, by our clients. Always delivering solutions that are both technically
                optimal and accurate on buisness side. </p>

            <img src="icons/plant.png">



            <p>Not only literally, as we're pretty big because of lockdown... Everyday is a lesson. Even in our daily
                job,
                we're looking for opportunities to gain new knowledge and experience. Never do we tell, that this is
                outside of our expertise - if it is, it just means it is now and we will pry upon the matter to resolve
                all kinds of problems. Being
                versatile and resourceful is
                one of our strongest points.</p>
